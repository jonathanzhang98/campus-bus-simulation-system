This Partial Assessment indicates a TA has begun grading your branches and issues. However, this will be graded using a tallying spreadsheed and grades will only be posted to Canvas once every student's branches and issues have been graded. We ask for your patience at this time.

  Please note: Branches are counted throughout Iteration 1. We are looking for branches you made and left alone during Iteration 1. Issues however are counted for the entirety of the semester. We ran into some glitches automatically grading this, so this is the solution we came up with.
